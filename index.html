or design team to create a signature custom City of Seattle typeface for use in the official City of 

Seattle logo and other materials such as significant architectural signage. The City wishes to 

create a custom typeface in order to best achieve brand coherence that is consistent across the 

many departments and programs of the City, and across the many platforms, both online and 

physical, that exist for City communications. The City will maintain exclusive rights to the 

typeface.</p>
