<b>Zach Burba is arguably the hardest working guy in show business. I first met him about '07 when he moved from Arizona. Zach's brother makes videos on youtube that totally rock. With a little research, youll find them. Zach spreads love and leaks inspiration. Lucky to know this fellow. I went to his birthday party last year in Seattle and you werent allowed to talk. It was fun to catch up with people i hadn't seen in a long time without words! I first met Harley Thompson that same night when I was leaving - he rocks! Also met Charlie D, he did a hilarious silent story book reading (this guy rocks), and lots of bands silent jammed. Claire england is good at electric bass and the imaginary bass also. It was hard to keep quiet because it was so funny and cool. Thrilled to have him on 1.b.l.!</b><br><br>
